								<h2>Experience</h2>
								<p>I first started working when I was 16. My first job was as a bellboy/receptionist at Hotel Elena in Golden Sands</p>
								<p>After that summer job I started working in the Uk for a while after covid hit. I managed to work at McDonalds and KFC there which back then I was pessimistic about but looking back now I can appreciate the friends and memories(and money) I made.</p>
								<p>After I came back I found myself going to Sofia and starting studying there and while I did that I had to find myself a job. I started working part time at a company called B EYE as a technical support specialist. I learned a lot there but the fact that I was working mainly Night shifts didn't reflect on me very well. After a 5 months working there I got an opportunity to be an Front-end intern at a company called Trading212. I immediately took the opportunity and although I am not with them anymore I can say that putting coding to practical use in that type of inviroment was a first for me and made me realise a lot of things. After my Internship there ended I continued studying. Right now I am at the point where I am searching for either a long-term position as a Software enginner at a company or finding potential clients and working as a freelancer. I am pursuing both right now and would love to hear from you if you are reading this.</p>
								<h2>Random stuff about me</h2>
								<p>I was born in Varna. I love playing and watching sports - particullary football and basketball(Forza Milan and go Lakers!). I love listening to music(currently listening to <a href ='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blYo4WheVgA&ab_channel=MacMiller'>this</a> give it a listen). I love reading books(favourite one is Stephen King's 22.11.1963). That's about it</p>
